        <strong>What is Vanilla JS </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Vanilla JS means regular Javascript, without any libraries or
        abstractions called frameworks. It is used straight out of box along
        with HTML and CSS. Nowadays we are flooded with Javascript libraries and
        frameworks. A beginner might not know difference between frameworks and
        libraries and for small toy apps, they start using shiny frameworks. A
        good developer should know when to use what.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why it is important to learn Vanilla JS </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Though frameworks and libraries makes our life much easier. One needs to
        know plain javascript to appreciate frameworks and the abstraction they
        provide. Truth about frameworks is that they come and go. Just 4-5 years
        back, JQuery was the rage, now Angular, ReactJS, VueJS is topping
        charts. What is common in them is the use of javacript,html and
        css. So if you learn vanilla js, html and css, you can pick
        up any framework with ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Conclusion </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not against any framework, but before jumping to any, one should
        take a look at some plain old javascript.
